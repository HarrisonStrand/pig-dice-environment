## **Usage / Examples (Game Rules)**
The goal of the game is to be the first player to have a score of at least 100.  Each player takes turns rolling a die (pressing the "Roll" button), which will give them a random value between 1 and 6.  If the die rolls 2-6, that value is added to their "Turn Total".  At any time, the player can choose to hold (press the "Hold" button).  Holding will end their turn and add the Turn Total to their score. If the player rolls a 1, then their Turn Total returns to 0, nothing is added to their score, and their turn ends.
